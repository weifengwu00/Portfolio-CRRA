The program runs smoothly and produces the two desired graphs. The author also makes detailed comment augmenting the code. I do not find any difficulty in understanding the code. Though it does not matter in terms of coding, the graphs would look better if the lines have some color.

One additional but trivial comment is that for some unknown reasons the xlabel and ylabel of the graph doesn't show in the department computer. I tried to run the program on my computer and they also are not there.

Finally, I would give the author check+ for this program homework.
